# CarEvaluation

Data Analysis on Car Dataset

# Project Description

This project performs data analysis on a dataset (car.csv) to extract insights and visualize data trends. It leverages Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization. The dataset includes columns such as buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety, and class, which represent characteristics of cars and their corresponding classifications.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization using matplotlib
- Insights into car characteristics and classifications
